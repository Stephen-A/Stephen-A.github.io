Welcome to my portfolio project! This is a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences as a developer. The portfolio is built using React.js for the frontend, with HTML and CSS for structure and styling. Tailwind CSS is used to streamline the styling process and create a visually appealing and responsive design.

This is currently a work in progress, and I will be making updated throughout the development of
this landing page, as well as uploading personal projects that I will be creating to further develop my skills, and learn more about the React framework, Tailwind, and other technologies that I may implement.
